    <h1>Black-capped chickadee</h1>
    <p class="first_p">The black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) is a small, nonmigratory, North American
        passerine bird that
        lives in deciduous and mixed forests. It is a member of the Paridae family, also known as tits. It has a
        distinct black cap on its head, a black bib underneath, and white cheeks. It has a white belly, buff sides, and
        grey wings, back, and tail. The bird is well known for its vocalizations, including its fee-bee song and its
        chick-a-dee-dee-dee call, from which it derives its name. The black-capped chickadee is widely distributed
        throughout North America, ranging from the northern United
        States to southern Canada and all the way up to Alaska and Yukon. It feeds primarily on insects and seeds, and
        is known for its ability to cache food for use during the winter. The hippocampus of the black-capped chickadee
        grows during the caching season, which is believed to help it better remember its cache locations. The
        black-capped chickadee is a social bird and forms strict dominance hierarchies within its flock. During the
        winter, these flocks include other bird species. It has the ability to lower its body temperature during cold
        winter nights, allowing it to conserve energy.
    </p>

    <p class="second_p">Black-capped chickadees build nests in tree cavities, with the nesting season starting in late
        April and lasting
        until late June. They lay on average 6–8 eggs, which hatch after 11–14 days. Juveniles fledge 12–16 days after
        hatching. The population of black-capped chickadees is thought to be increasing, and they are considered a
        species of
        least
        concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is the state bird of both Massachusetts
        and
        Maine in the United States, and the provincial bird of New Brunswick in Canada.

    <h1>Greater spotted eagle</h1>
    <p>The greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), also called the spotted eagle, is a large migratory bird of prey in
        the family Accipitridae.

        It is a member of the subfamily Aquilinae, commonly known as "booted eagles".[2] It was once classified as a
        member of the genus Aquila, but has been reclassified to the distinct genus Clanga, along with the two other
        species of spotted eagle.[3]</p>
    <p>During breeding season, greater spotted eagles are widely distributed across Eastern Europe, parts of Central
        Europe, central Russia, central Asia and parts of China, along with other isolated areas. During winter, they
        migrate, primarily to South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the upper Mediterranean Basin, and parts of
        East Africa.[1][4] Greater spotted eagles favor wetter habitats than most other booted eagles, preferring
        riparian zones as well as bogs, lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water surrounded by woodland. They breed
        primarily on floodplains, especially ones that experience high water levels. During winter and migration, they
        often seek out similar wetland habitats, but have also been observed in dry upland areas such as savanna
        plateaus.[4][5]</p>
    <p>The eagle is an opportunistic forager, especially during the winter. It will readily scavenge a variety of food
        sources, including carrion, as well as small mammals (principally rodents), frogs, and a variety of smaller
        birds (especially water birds), and occasionally reptiles and insects. The eagle is primarily an aerial hunter,
        gliding from concealed perches over marshes or wet fields to catch prey</p>
